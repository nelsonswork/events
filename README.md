## Front-End Tech Test

We'd like you to build a list of shows that can be filtered by genre.

![design](design.jpg)

On initial load 'All' should be pre-selected, and all shows should be shown.

Subsequently, if a genre filter is selected, only shows of that genre should be shown.

----------------------------

In this repo you will find:

#### Mock Data

A JSON file with some shows. It has been structured specifically for the design shown.

`./data/shows.json`

#### Images

In `./img` you will find the Sofar Sounds logo, a banner image for the header and the arrow icon.
